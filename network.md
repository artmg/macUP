#Â macOS networking

This part of the [macUP macOS setup process](https://github.com/artmg/macUP/) focuses on: 

* initial configuration settings
* diagnostics
* advanced configuration

[macUP]() is a public repository 
used to install and configure a macOS device in an efficient, uniform and comprehensive way.Any sensitive or personal settings should be kept separately in your own *Private Configuration Notes*.

## Configuration

## Diagnostics

Includes some workarounds in the form of advanced configuration

### Routing

```
# check the current routes
netstat -rn

# just show net routes for IPv4
netstat -rn -f inet

networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder
```

#### order

Note that macOS routing choices is not weighted by a route priority so much as by range-specificity (prefer a route containing less addresses) and adapter priority

```
# check the current service order
networksetup -listnetworkserviceorder

# rearrange (needs full service name, not just en0 device id)
networksetup -ordernetworkservices "Apple USB Ethernet Adapter" "USB 10/100/1000 LAN" "Wi-Fi" "Bluetooth PAN"
```

This is the equivalent of System Prefs / Network / (service list drop down) Set Service Order...

Onc you reconnect (e.g. turn the wifi off and on again) the default routes will now be added in the 'right order'.



## Issues

### rename on wake

`Computer hostmame already on network`

In some circumstances macOS can automatically change the hostname. It does this to avoid duplicates, for instance if you 
multi-home your device by using both wifi and ethernet onto the 
same subnet (especially if you are using DHCP). 

However it can also do this inadvertently when it comes out of resume.
You may see the message 

```
This computer's hostname is already in use on this network. 
The name has been changed to ...
```

If you are sure that there is no reason why there might be 
another device with that name, you can fix it using **scutil**

```
sudo echo 

originalhostname=`scutil --get ComputerName | cut -f1 -d" "`
echo Setting hostname back to $originalhostname

# check the current settings
for key in LocalHostName ComputerName  HostName  ; do scutil --get $key; done

# set the local host and computer - for now the HostName is unset!
for key in LocalHostName ComputerName  ; do sudo scutil --set $key $originalhostname; done

for key in LocalHostName ComputerName  HostName  ; do scutil --get $key; done
