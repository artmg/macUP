# macUP README.md

**macUP** is a generic macOS setup process, aiming to get a macOS 
device set up 
in an efficient, uniform and comprehensive way. 

Although it is based on a personal preference for certain aspects of setup, it has gathered a series of tips and techniques from other sources, and 
is publicly re-sharing them with the presumption that there's no harm.

It does however presume the harm in sharing details about 
accounts used, data locations and highly personal application configuration â€“ 
that's why it is structured to assume that you also maintain your own 
*Private Configuration Notes* 
for the details you would not want to share publicly.
