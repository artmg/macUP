## Characters and accents

An easy way that usually works is to hold the key for a second and release it before it starts repeating.

Option Key gives the others:

` grave
e acute
i  circumflex
n tilde
u umlaut

then type the next letter

For other common characters use Option and the letter (o ø - a å etc)

See the table at https://forlang.wsu.edu/help-pages/help-pages-keyboards-os-x/


## suggested tweaks

apple dictate - for TTS, change the key cmd to option+tilde


## Shortcuts in Terminal
